Create Grade class

a. There are two quizzes, each graded on the basis of 10 points.

b. There is one midterm exam and one final exam, each graded on the basis of 100 points.

c. The final exam counts for 50% of the grade, the midterm counts for 25%,and the two quizzes
together count for a total of 25%. (Do not forget to normalize the quiz scores. They should be converted
to a percentage before they are averaged in.).

Any grade of 90 or more is an A, any grade of 80 or more (but less than 90) is a B, any grade of 70 or
more (but less than 80) is a C, any grade of 60 or more (but less than 70) is a D, and any grade below 60 is an F.

The program will ask for the score in each exam and output the studentâ€™s record, which consists of two quiz and
two exam scores as well as the studentâ€™s average numeric score for the entire course and final letter grade.

Define and use a class for the student record.  Use setter and getter methods, do not manipulate the class
data directly.
